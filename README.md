## Supporting code and data for 'Assessing the value of citizen scientist observations in tracking the abundance of marine fishes'

## Files
- `state_space_model_runs.R:`: processes data and fits combined state-space models for all species.

- `functions.R`: all functions written for the analysis are placed in this file.
  
- `model_summary_analyses.R`: post-hoc analyses of model fits (run through 'state_space_models_runs.R' first).

- Note to run code need data unzipped in this folder. For now data can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iMx7xYe09xcqGZr_LkSsjhIWhZj3Yu_T/view?usp=drive_link (will be put into a permanent repository)
